# Multi-Agent Research Assistant

I built this to explore how multiple LLM agents can collaborate on a research task - each one handling a specific job rather than dumping everything into a single prompt.

The system runs fully locally using Ollama, so no API keys or costs involved.

---

## How it works

When you ask a question, six agents run in sequence:

1. **Planner** breaks the question into concrete research tasks
2. **Researcher** searches the web via DuckDuckGo and stores results in ChromaDB
3. **Analyst** pulls from both current results and past memory to extract insights
4. **Graph Builder** extracts entities (companies, trends, technologies) and stores relationships in Neo4j - runs at low temperature for consistent JSON output
5. **Writer** turns those insights into a structured report - runs at slightly higher temperature for more varied prose
6. **Critic** reviews the report and flags anything missing or unclear

The vector memory means the system gets slightly smarter over repeated queries on similar topics. The knowledge graph lets you query relationships between entities via GraphQL.

If DuckDuckGo rate-limits or returns nothing, the researcher retries up to 3 times with a short delay before giving up and returning an empty result set rather than crashing the pipeline.

## Running locally

You'll need [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed.

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama serve
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Option 1 - CLI:**
```bash
python main.py
```

**Option 2 - API + UI (two terminals):**
```bash
# terminal 1
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# terminal 2
streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py
```

UI at `http://localhost:8501`, API docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`, GraphQL at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql`.

**Option 3 - Docker (includes Neo4j):**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
bash setup.sh  # first time only
```

---

## Fine-tuning (PEFT + LoRA)

The writer agent can be swapped between the default Ollama model and a locally fine-tuned LoRA adapter.

```bash
# step 1 - generate training data using your own agents (ollama must be running)
python training/generate_training_data.py

# step 2 - fine-tune (opt-125m, runs on CPU in ~2 min)
python training/finetune.py

# step 3 - run with fine-tuned writer
set USE_FINETUNED=1 && python main.py   # Windows
USE_FINETUNED=1 python main.py          # Linux/Mac

# step 4 - evaluate before vs after
python training/evaluate_finetuning.py
```

The writer falls back to Ollama automatically if the adapter hasn't been trained or if `USE_FINETUNED` is not set.

---

## Running tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests use mocks so Ollama and Neo4j don't need to be running.

To verify all components end to end (requires Ollama and uvicorn running):

```bash
# terminal 1
ollama serve

# terminal 2
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# terminal 3
python run_all.py
```

Neo4j checks are skipped automatically if Docker isn't running. To include them:

```bash
docker start neo4j
```

## Evaluation

### Multi-agent vs single-agent

I ran the pipeline against a single-agent baseline on the query *"What are the latest trends in renewable energy?"* and scored both using an LLM judge.

| Criteria     | Multi-agent | Single-agent |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Relevance    | 9/10        | 9/10         |
| Completeness | 8.5/10      | 8/10         |
| Clarity      | 9/10        | 9/10         |
| Accuracy     | 8/10        | 8.5/10       |

The multi-agent output was better structured and more complete. The single-agent scored slightly higher on accuracy due to citing sources inline.

### Fine-tuning evaluation

I evaluated the LoRA fine-tuned writer (opt-125m, 125M params, 10 examples) against the Ollama baseline (llama3.2, 3B params).

| Criteria     | Ollama (llama3.2) | LoRA (opt-125m) |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Relevance    | 9/10              | 4/10            |
| Completeness | 8/10              | 6/10            |
| Clarity      | 9/10              | 7/10            |
| Accuracy     | 8/10              | 5/10            |

The fine-tuned model underperforms because opt-125m is 24x smaller than llama3.2 and was trained on only 10 examples. The purpose of this component is to demonstrate the end-to-end fine-tuning workflow - data generation, LoRA training, adapter loading, and quantitative evaluation - rather than to beat a much larger model. A fair comparison would require fine-tuning a model of comparable size with significantly more training data.

---

## Known limitations

- `llama3.2` is a 3B model - outputs can be vague on complex topics. `mistral` or `llama3.1:8b` give better results.
- ChromaDB runs in-memory by default, so vector memory resets on each restart.
- DuckDuckGo occasionally rate-limits - the researcher retries 3 times before returning empty.
- The graph builder relies on the LLM returning valid JSON - falls back to empty entity set if parsing fails.
- Neo4j must be running separately (via Docker) for the knowledge graph to work. The pipeline skips it gracefully if unavailable.
- The LoRA fine-tuned writer uses opt-125m which is too small for high-quality report generation without significantly more training data.

---

## Possible next steps

- Fine-tune a larger model (e.g. llama3.2) with more training data for meaningful quality improvement
- Add source citations directly in the final report
- Persistent ChromaDB storage across sessions
- Streaming responses via WebSockets
- Visualise the knowledge graph in the Streamlit UI
- API authentication for deployment
